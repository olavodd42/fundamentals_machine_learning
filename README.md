## Setup

Most projects use Python and common data science libraries such as:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- SciPy
- Scikit-learn

To set up your environment:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scipy scikit-learn
```

## Usage

Each project directory contains its own code and data files. Navigate to the specific project directory and run the main script to see results.

Example:
```bash
cd AB_Test_Nosh_Mish_Mosh
python script.py
```
